# [Your Project Name] Project Status

<!-- 
ARC Framework Template: Copy this file and customize for your project
- Replace [Your Project Name] with your actual project name
- This document tracks current progress and upcoming work
- Update regularly as features move from planning → implementation → completion
- Keep this objective and measurable - concrete deliverables, not intentions
-->

## Current State Overview

<!-- 
Provide a brief, high-level summary of where your project stands:
- What phase of development (early, active, mature, maintenance)
- Overall progress toward META-PRD objectives
- Key recent accomplishments
- Current development focus
-->

[Your Project Name] is [brief description of current development state - e.g., "in active development",
"nearing completion", "entering maintenance phase"]. [Brief summary of overall progress and current focus area].

> **Planning Note**: For completed work, this document reflects objective metrics and concrete
> deliverables. For upcoming/planned features, add explicit acceptance criteria as work approaches execution:
>
> - Technical specifications and implementation details
> - User interface mockups and user flows
> - Testing requirements (unit, integration, end-to-end)
> - Performance benchmarks and quality standards  
> - Documentation and deployment requirements
> - Links to PRDs, task lists, and related issues/PRs
>
> This ensures planned work becomes actionable and measurable as it moves from concept to implementation.

## Completed Work

<!-- 
List major features/components that are fully implemented and functional:
- Group related functionality together
- Include objective measures (test coverage, endpoints, performance)
- Note completion dates for significant milestones

<!-- Add more completed milestones as needed -->

## Work in Progress

<!-- 
List features/areas currently under active development:
- Be specific about what's actually in progress vs planned
- Include current status and blockers if any
- Reference active PRDs or task lists where relevant
- Note if work is paused and why
-->

### 🚧 [Active Development Area 1]

- [Specific work item in progress with current status]
- [Another active work item and its current state]
- [Any blockers or dependencies affecting progress]

### 🚧 [Active Development Area 2]

- **Current Status**: [Brief description of where this work stands]
- [Specific progress made and remaining work]
- [Expected completion timeframe if known]

<!-- Note: Keep this section focused - if something isn't actively being worked on, it belongs in "Upcoming Priorities" -->

## Upcoming Priorities

<!-- 
Organize future work by priority level:
- High Priority: Next major focus areas
- Medium Priority: Important but not immediate
- Lower Priority: Nice-to-have or deferred features
- Include branch names for work that's been started
-->

### High Priority

  - [Key deliverable 1]
  - [Key deliverable 2]
  - [Important capability to implement]
  - [Quality/performance requirement]
  - **Key Deliverables**: [Summary of main outcomes expected]

- **[Another High Priority Item]**:
  - [Specific requirement 1]
  - [Specific requirement 2]
  - [Integration or dependency consideration]

### Medium Priority

- **[Important Feature]**: [Brief description of scope and value]
- **[Another Medium Priority]**: [What this includes and why it matters]
- **[Technical Improvement]**: [System enhancement and expected benefit]

### Lower Priority

- **[Nice-to-Have Feature]**: [Brief scope description]
- **[Future Enhancement]**: [Longer-term improvement]
- **[Optional Integration]**: [External capability or service]

## Stretch Goals

<!-- 
Features that would be valuable but are beyond current scope:
- Nice-to-have functionality
- Advanced features for future consideration
- Experimental or innovative capabilities
- Features dependent on external factors
-->

- **[Stretch Feature 1]**: [Brief description and why it's a stretch goal]
