# Research Documents

Technical research and analysis documents that inform project decisions.

## Purpose

Research documents capture investigation findings, comparative analysis, and technical exploration
that may:

- Inform ADRs (architectural decisions)
- Guide strategy development
- Provide reference material for implementation
- Document external API behaviors or limitations

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `research-topic-description.md`

**Examples:**

- `research-api-rate-limiting.md`
- `research-authentication-patterns.md`
- `research-design-system-comparison.md`

## When to Write Research Docs

Write a research document when:

- Investigating external APIs or services
- Comparing multiple implementation approaches
- Documenting findings that don't fit in an ADR
- Capturing technical context for future reference

## Relationship to ADRs

Research documents often precede ADRs:

1. **Research** explores options and gathers data
2. **ADR** records the decision made based on research

Research may also stand alone when no decision is needed but the information is valuable.
