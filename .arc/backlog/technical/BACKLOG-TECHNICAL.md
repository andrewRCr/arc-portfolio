# Technical Backlog

**Purpose:** Organized collection of technical work ideas and plans - infrastructure, tooling,
modernization, and quality improvements.

**Processing:** Items move here from `TASK-INBOX.md` during weekly review. When ready to work on an item,
create a PRD/plan in `.arc/active/technical/` and begin the standard workflow.
