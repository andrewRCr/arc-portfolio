# Task Inbox

**Purpose:** Zero-friction capture for ideas, tasks, and work that needs processing.

**Keep this lean!** Items should not accumulate here. Process during weekly review:

- Quick actions (<5 min) → Do immediately
- Atomic tasks → Move to `active/ATOMIC-TASKS.md`
- Feature ideas → Move to `feature/BACKLOG-FEATURE.md`
- Technical ideas → Move to `technical/BACKLOG-TECHNICAL.md`
- Uncertain → Leave for next week's review

<!-- Capture anything here using simple bullets (no checkboxes, no numbers) -->
<!-- Examples: -->
<!-- - Explore {{capability}} -->
<!-- - Better error messages on {{page}} -->
<!-- - Fix typo in README line 47 -->
<!-- - Research {{technology}} options -->
